    "# Getting started with the command line/terminal\n",
    "Command line is a powerful way to navigate and create files/directories. Here, I overview basic commands for navigating unix/linux systems from command line interface (CLI) as opposed to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The commands can be run directly in this notebook by pressing the play button (sideways triangle) at the top of the page, or by clicking \"run selected cells\" under the run menu, or by pressing CTRL + ENTER for the selected cell.\n",

    "### Navigating your directories ```cd```,```pwd```\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your computer's file system as a large library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Files**: These are like individual books. Examples include \"metadata.csv\" or files ending with \".fasta\".\n",

    "2. **Directories (Folders)**: These are similar to shelves or sections in the library. For instance, a folder titled \"analysis\" on your Desktop.\n",

    "### Navigating in Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open the terminal, it's like you've just entered the library. To work with your files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to tell the computer which \"shelf\" (directory) to look at.\n",

    "* Asterisk (*): Represents any number of characters, including none14.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question mark (?): Represents exactly one character14.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Real-world Analogy\n",
    "Imagine you're looking for a book in a library, but you can't remember the exact title. Wildcards are like using partial information to find what you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you remember the book title starts with \"The Wild\", you could search for \"The Wild*\" to find all books beginning with those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you're not sure about one letter in a word, like \"b?g\", it could match \"bag\", \"big\", or \"bug\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Practical Examples\n",
    "To make it more concrete, you can use examples with file names:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"document*.txt\" would match \"document1.txt\", \"document_draft.txt\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"file?.csv\" would match \"file1.csv\", \"file2.csv\", but not \"file10.csv\"16.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Search for files more efficiently\n",

    "* Work with files even when you don't know their exact names"
