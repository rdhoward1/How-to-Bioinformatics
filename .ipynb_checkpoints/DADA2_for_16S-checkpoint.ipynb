    "## **DADA2** (Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2) is a widely used bioinformatics tool designed to process and analyze amplicon sequencing data, such as 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial communities or ITS regions for fungal communities. It is implemented primarily as an R package and offers high-resolution identification of microbial community composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of DADA2:\n",
    "### Error Modeling and Denoising:\n",
    "DADA2 uses a statistical model to identify and correct sequencing errors in amplicon data. This allows it to infer true biological sequences, referred to as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), with single-nucleotide resolution, outperforming traditional OTU-based methods that cluster sequences at a fixed similarity threshold (e.g., 97%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs):\n",
    "Instead of grouping sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), DADA2 identifies exact ASVs. This provides higher sensitivity and specificity, enabling the detection of subtle biological variations and improving reproducibility across studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Capabilities:\n",
    "DADA2 includes all steps necessary for processing sequencing data:\n",
    "* Quality filtering and trimming\n",
    "* Error rate learning\n",
    "* Sequence denoising\n",
    "* Merging paired-end reads\n",
    "* Chimera removal\n",
    "* Taxonomic assignment using reference databases like SILVA or UNITE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications:\n",
    "DADA2 is used for microbiome studies in various fields, including environmental science, human health, and agriculture. It supports both bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS) amplicons, making it versatile for microbial community profiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration with Other Tools:\n",
    "The output of DADA2 can be seamlessly integrated with downstream analysis tools such as Phyloseq for ecological and statistical analyses, as well as visualization of microbiome data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages Over Traditional Methods:\n",
    "* Higher resolution by distinguishing sequences differing by even a single nucleotide.\n",
    "* Improved accuracy in detecting true biological sequences while minimizing spurious results.\n",
    "* Scalability for large datasets with efficient computational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DADA2 is a powerful tool for high-resolution microbial community analysis, offering precise sequence inference and robust handling of sequencing errors. It has become a standard in microbiome research due to its accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "* Demultiplexed paired-end FASTQ files (forward/reverse reads per sample)\n",
    "* Removed PCR primers from sequences\n",
    "* R environment with installed DADA2 package\n",

The ```learnErrors``` step in DADA2 is where the algorithm figures out the error patterns in your sequencing data.

DADA2 builds a model of these errors to help distinguish real biological sequences from mistakes introduced during sequencing.\n",
