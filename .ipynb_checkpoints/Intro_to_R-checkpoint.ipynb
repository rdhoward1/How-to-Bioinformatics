    "# An Intro to R & RStudio\n",
    "R is a programming language primarily designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization. Unlike Python or Java, R is a domain-specific language (DSL) optimized for statistics. Its syntax is array-oriented, and it emphasizes vectorized operations for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of R**\n",
    "- **Statistical \\& Data Analysis**: Built-in functions for linear/nonlinear modeling, hypothesis testing, clustering, time-series analysis, and more.\n",
    "- **Data Visualization**: Native support for high-quality plots (e.g., ggplot2 for publication-ready graphics)\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Over 18,000+ packages (e.g., Bioconductor for bioinformatics, tidyverse for data wrangling).\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Integrates with C/C++, Python, and SQL, and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Use Cases**\n",
    "- **Bioinformatics**: DNA sequence analysis (Biostrings), RNA-seq (DESeq2).\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling (caret, randomForest).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ecosystem**\n",
    "- **RStudio**: Preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with tools for debugging, package management, and Knitr for reproducible reports.\n",
    "- **CRAN \\& Bioconductor**: Central repositories for packages necessary to run your analyses.\n",

    "### Step 1: Install R & RStudio\n",
    "The first thing you're going to do is install R and RStudio from the internet:\n",
    "1. Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (choose your OS).\n",
    "2. Download RStudio (Desktop version) from [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).\n",

    "You can think of **R** as the engine of a car. It‚Äôs what makes everything go.\n",

    "When you install R, you‚Äôre installing this core language. Technically, you could write and run R code in a plain text editor or a terminal window... but it wouldn‚Äôt be very user-friendly.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### üñ•Ô∏è **RStudio**: The Friendly Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "**RStudio** is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**‚Äîbasically, a nice interface built *on top* of R to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives you:\n",
    "- A **Console** to type and run code\n",
    "- A **Script editor** to write and save code files\n",
    "- A **Viewer** for plots and data tables\n",
    "- A **File pane** to browse your project folders\n",
    "- An **Environment pane** to see your variables and data\n",

    "RStudio is a user-friendly interface designed to make working with the R programming language easier, especially for data analysis and bioinformatics. When you open RStudio, you‚Äôll see that the window is divided into four main panels (or panes), each with a specific role:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Source (Script Editor) ‚Äì Top Left**\n",
    "* Purpose: This is where you write, edit, and save your R scripts (code files), RMarkdown documents, or notes.\n",
    "* How to use: If you don‚Äôt see it at first, create a new script via the menu: File > New File > R Script. Code written here can be saved for future use.\n",
    "* Tip: Write your code here and use the \"Run\" button or Ctrl+Enter (Windows) / Cmd+Enter (Mac) to send a line or selection to the Console\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Console ‚Äì Bottom Left**\n",
    "* Purpose: This is where R executes your commands and displays the results. Think of it as R‚Äôs direct command line.\n",
    "* How to use: Type commands here for quick tests or exploration. Results appear immediately below your command.\n",
    "* Tip: Commands run here are not saved unless you copy them to a script\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Environment/History ‚Äì Top Right**\n",
    "* Environment Tab: Shows all the objects (variables, data frames, functions) you‚Äôve created in your current session. You can see their names, types, and sometimes a preview of their contents.\n",
    "* History Tab: Keeps a record of all the commands you‚Äôve run. You can reuse previous commands by clicking them.\n",
    "* Tip: You can remove objects from the environment here, or click on them to inspect their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer ‚Äì Bottom Right**\n",
    "* Files: Browse your computer‚Äôs folders and files.\n",
    "* Plots: View any graphs or charts you create with R.\n",
    "* Packages: See which R packages are installed; load or update them here.\n",
    "* Help: Search for help on R functions and packages.\n",
    "* Viewer: View web content or HTML outputs generated by RMarkdown.\n",
    "* Tip: Click the tabs to switch between these tools as you work.\n",
    "\n",

Unlike some programming languages, R doesn‚Äôt require you to declare a variable ahead of time‚Äîit‚Äôs created automatically when you assign a value to it.\n",
