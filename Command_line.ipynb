Here, I overview basic commands for navigating unix/linux systems from command line interface (CLI) as opposed to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The commands can be run directly in this notebook by pressing the play button (sideways triangle) at the top of the page, or by clicking \"run selected cells\" under the run menu, or by pressing CTRL + ENTER for the selected cell.\n## Understanding Computer File Systems\n\n### Navigating your directories ```cd```,```pwd```\n\nThink of your computer's file system as a large library:\n\n1. **Files**: These are like individual books. Examples include \"metadata.csv\" or files ending with \".fasta\".\n\n2. **Directories (Folders)**: These are similar to shelves or sections in the library. For instance, a folder titled \"analysis\" on your Desktop.\n\n3. **Pathways**: These are like the directions to find a specific book in the library.\n\n### File System Structure\n\nImagine your computer's storage as a tree:\n\n- The root (/) is the base of the tree.\n- Branches are directories (folders).\n- Leaves are files.\n\nLet's say:\n\n1. You have a folder called \"analysis\" on your Desktop.\n2. Inside this folder, you have:\n   - A file named \"metadata.csv\"\n   - Multiple files ending with \".fasta\"\n\nThe pathway is like an address for files and folders:\n\n- Full pathway example: /Users/YourUsername/Desktop/analysis/\n- Shortcut notation: ~/Desktop/analysis/\n  (where ~ represents your home directory)\n\n### Navigating in Terminal\n\nWhen you open the terminal, it's like you've just entered the library. To work with your files:\n\n1. You need to tell the computer which \"shelf\" (directory) to look at.\n2. You do this by navigating to the correct pathway.\n3. Use commands like `cd` (change directory) to move to the right location.\n\nLet's try it out below.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"e3668eb3-296c-4612-9e92-2775d8da5194","cell_type":"code","source":"cd ~/unix_intro/","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"5ee381e5-2dd8-4418-9927-cba52ec19f60","cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is equivalent to saying, \"Take me to the 'unix_intro' shelf in the folder 'jovyan' on the home directory in this Jupyter Notebook.\"\n\n### The 'unix_intro' folder is now your *working directory*. **What is a working directory?**\nA working directory is the folder on a drive where you're actively storing and accessing data for a specific project or analysis.
