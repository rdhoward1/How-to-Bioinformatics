Now, let's explore how we can interact directly with plain text files, such as .txt, .tsv, and .csv, using the command line. This skill is especially valuable when working with genomic data, where you often need to count the number of FASTA sequences, inspect file contents, or even make quick edits. The command line provides powerful tools to accomplish all of these tasks efficiently—let’s dive in! \n\n*Remember, if you need help with any of these commands further, you can always use the built-in help menus that we can access by providing ```-h``` or ```--help``` as the only argument.*\n\n**I want to note that many of these commands will not work on files that are not plain text.

I know this one was a little bit more intensive, but remember that you can always look these commands and their flags up. What's important is getting the syntax down.\n\n> If you need any more practice, please play around in the terminal. ","metadata":{}}]}
